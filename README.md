# Global-Energy-Production-Consumption-Analysis
The goal of this data analysis and visualization project is to provide an overview of the world's energy landscape from 1973 to 2022. By examining monthly data on energy production, consumption, imports, exports, and utilization from various sources such as renewables, nuclear, and fossil fuels, this project aims to identify trends, patterns, and shifts in global energy dynamics. Through interactive visualizations, this analysis seeks to offer insights into energy consumption patterns, resource utilization, and their impact on the energy market and sustainability.
# Overview
In this project, we employ advanced data analysis techniques and interactive visualizations to uncover historical shifts in energy production and consumption from 1973 to 2022. By examining monthly data on renewables, nuclear, and fossil fuels, we explore the intricate dynamics and interactions between various energy resources. Our goal is to identify key factors and trends that have shaped the global energy landscape over the years. Additionally, we investigate the broader implications of these trends on sustainability and the environment, offering insights into how changes in energy production and consumption impact ecological balance and resource management, supporting informed decision-making for a sustainable future.
This project primarily focuses on visualization. To achieve a comprehensive understanding, I used graphs, pie charts, statistics, world maps, and various plotting techniques to differentiate energy production and consumption across five decades. To support this analysis, I utilized three datasets (mentioned below). These tools and datasets collectively help illustrate the trends and dynamics in global energy production, consumption, and trade from 1973 to 2022.
